# Usable Authentication and Passwords

## Password Attacks

- Human
- Brute force
- Common word
- Dictionary word

## Two-Factor Authentication

- Password & one time unique code
  + Generated by
    - Device
    - Email
    - Text
    - App

### Security of TFA

- More secure
- Stops most hacking attacks
- Users perceive it as more secure

### Usability of TFA

- Research says:
  + Speed: Slower
  + User Preference;
    - Felt less usable
    - Less convenient
    - Harder to use

## Biometric Authentication

- Fingerprints, voice and facial scan etc.

### Usability of Biometrics

- Voice Recognition
  + Speed: medium
  + Efficiency: medium
  + Learnability: easy
  + Memorability: easy

- Facial Recognition
  + Speed: medium
  + Efficiency: medium
  + Learnability: easy
  + Memorability: easy

- Fingerprint Recognition
  + Speed: fast
  + Efficiency: good
  + Learnability: easy
  + Memorability: easy

### Analyzing Security

- Who can access the device?
- How easily can they replicate the biometrics input?

## Gesture-based Authentication

- Keypad Gestures
- Free Gestures
- Draw your Signatures
- Multi-touch

### Benefits

- Gestures users enjoy tend to be more secure
- Users prefer gestures to passwords
- Faster than passwords, less error-prone
