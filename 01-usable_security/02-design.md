# Design: design methodology, prototyping, cybersecurity case study

## Intro to Design

- Have the insight of the users who are they.
- To include children or not.
- Testing your design with users.
- Involving the users from the very start of your design.
- What other people are doing in your niche, and you should probably design something similar for familiarity reasons of mental models
- Define your goal, is it innovative idea, or something already existing but adding a value over it.
- Don't wait until your product is finished, take input from the users from the very first stage of design.

## Design Methodologies

### Design Process
  
  The Golden rule is;
  > Know Your User.

- Where do ideas come from?
- Many processes;
  + Iterative design

  + System centered design

    - What can be built easily on this platform?
    - What can I create from the available tools?
    - What do I as a programmer find interesting to work on?
    
  + User centered design

    - Design is based upon a user's
      + Abilities and real needs
      + Context
      + Work
      + Tasks

  + Participatory design

    - Problem
      + intuitions wrong
      + interviews etc. not precise
      + designer cannot know the user sufficiently well to answer all issues that come up during the design
    - Solution
      + designers should have access to pool of representative users. That is, END users, not their managers or union reps!

  + Designer centered design

    "It's not the consumers' job to know what they want."
            -- Steve Jobs

## Case Study: SSL Warnings - example user

- User knows something bad is happening, but not what.
- User has good general strategies (worry more about sites with sensitive info)
- Error message relies on a lot of information users don't understand
